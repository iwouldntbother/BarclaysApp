# Barclays App / Website Redesign

This is all for a university project.
Our brief is to find a flaw in a brand and create something for the brand to use in order to fix the flaw or reach a currently unreached audience

## Our Plan
We plan to improve the Barclays banking app, opening it up for kids and elderly people to use comfortably
